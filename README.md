grails-guitr
============

Grails (web) UI Test Runner for spock.

I am still in pre-alpha, please do not even attempt to use. In the short term, I'm still in exploratory mode, and haven't even started writing tests. 

Motivating this is a frustration in the time it takes to restart tests in grails, and is influenced by Kotori Web JUnit Runner. 

This is a precursor to SUITR, the Scala UI Test Runner. 


TODO:
Single selection: select 1 test - is this necessary?
Multiple selection: select multiple tests
